# Elevator Manager

What about writing a program for managing elevators in a block of flats? 

Take into account that it could be more than one lift in a building. Do consider a very high structure, where lift shafts are separated due to the height of the architecture, so you can't move up without an interruption to change a cabin.

Think about that lifts can change their state, e.g., being in use or being on service or broken, etc.

Do come out with useful features like, e.g., measuring the weight of payload of a cabin or fool protection for buttons or saving energy, etc.

Please, use clear Python, non of external modules except your own.
